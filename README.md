# WARNING --  NOT YET STABLE -- IN PROCESS OF PORTING

## A piece of emergent tooling

> The product of 7 years of LED projects, which solves a simple problem- converting commonly used color space representations to be able to tbe translated to RGBW for use with RGBW LEDs (you won't believe the pastels RGBW makes possible).

## Authors

GrgB wrote the vast majority of the core. JM translated Brian Nettlers theoretical work into code to allow the HS* and RGBW translations, JC added a lot of robustness and filled a bunch of gaps. And going on 10 years of users for our art projects, we've had TL, JH, SD, ZB, MF, LN all add their own touches here and there.  This library was (most recently) pulled out of pyramidscheme/pyramidtriagles, which was a fork of the original pyramid triangles codebase (a collab w/Steve Dudek), which was itself a port of the bitbucket repo which controlled the original BAAAHS light systems, which was developed out of the HEX collective original s/w for controlling LED art installations circa 2010.  This library being largely untouched until the need to support RGBW LEDs (and boy are they pretty).  Honorable mentions really go to Gbrn (for writing the majority of the bones) and Brian Nettler (for having worked out the transform to RGBW and publishing it openly-  see source for references).

## Intention

To make this bite sized and easy to use, stripping out any cruft and trying to make it as broadly compatible with at least most of python 3 versions.  Python 2.7 compatibility is not too much of a stretch to sort out for anyone who wants to fork that.


# Requirements
